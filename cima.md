# Common Information Model for Agriculture

CIMA is a logical data model, with well defined semantic meaning along with a syntactic binding and clear notion of identity for things and model constructs. The model is supported by well defined controlled vocabularies. 

## Principles

- We must describe reality as it actually is, using data objects and relationships between them.
- We will reuse what already exists that works well, now and in the future.
- An ID should not be meaningful.
- An ID must be unique and unchangeable
- An ID must have clear ownership with associated responsibility for management
- The model is machine readable
- Out of scope is the definition of business process and interactions related to the model. e.g. what does it mean to receive a AnimalPurchaseEvent is not defined.
