# Semantic Interoperability in Norwegian Agriculture through Data

Semantic interoperability is the ability of computer systems to exchange data, in well defined manner and with unambiguous meaning. Improving data exhange between and within organisations enables greater data quality and less cost in moving and understanding data. This in turn leads to improved and new business processes that directly improve the industry. 

# Background

OPS-Landbruk sees that like most industries agriculture and general land use actors are in greater need to sharing and understanding the common data elements that make up their digital worlds. 

Based on the guidelines defined at digdir.no https://www.digdir.no/digital-samhandling/rammeverk-digital-samhandling/2148#nr_br_du_bruke_rammeverket, the technical working groups of OPS-Landbruk have 

# Livestock Agriculture Information Model - High Level Scope

Our mission is to prepare a proposal for a common and open data model for agriculture, it will describe the domain through data objects and relationships between them, and adopt an event centric approach.

We will replace proprietary models that require "interpretation" when sharing data.
We must cover the needs of the farmer, other commercial interests and authorities.
We will facilitate simplification, improvement and automation.
The model must be suitable for further development and scaling.
The model must cooperate well with other shared information models.

See the spec at [working draft](spec.html). Create [issues](https://github.com/datautvikling/Semantisk-samhandling-OPS-L/issues) if things need fixing or have been missed.


# Use Cases Document

The LAIM data model looks to support many different use cases and also provide value and support as new situations arise.

To help guide and anchor the development of the information model we capture the various uses cases. We strive for each use case to be as minimal as possible in order to facilitate concise modelling.





# Data Exchange Protocol - High Level Scope

A web enabled protocol for the exchange of data entities that correspond to the LAIM data model. A generic approach to data sharing that allows for future model constructs to be exhanged without need to change the protocol.
